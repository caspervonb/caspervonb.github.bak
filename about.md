I'm Casper Beyer, I'm in my early mid twenties, self-taught omni-developer since i got my hands on a Commadore 64.
I've been spending way to many years learning useless talents, at one point i was an amateur animator, then i stumbled into fine art but the fancy champagne parties just wasn't for me.

These days I am focusing on javascript based game development and general freelance development work.

## Why do you blog?
I've learned way to much, and i like teaching.

## How can I contact you?
