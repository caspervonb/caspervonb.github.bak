I'm Casper Beyer, I'm in my mid twenties. I am a self-taught omni-developer, I've been at it ever since i got my hands on a Commadore 64 and 386 machines way back in the days.

I've been spending way to many years learning useless talents, at one point i was an amateur animator, then i stumbled into a fine art education but the fancy champagne parties just wasn't for me.

These days I am contractor running my own small shop, outside of client work, I focus on javascript based game development, I am available for hire so feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting project going on, I'm well versed in C, C++ and JavaScript (front and backend).

## How can I contact you?
