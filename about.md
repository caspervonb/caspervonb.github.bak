I'm Casper Beyer, I'm in my early to mid twenties, self-taught omni-developer since i got my hands on a Commadore 64 way back as a toddler.
I've been spending way to many years learning useless talents, at one point i was an amateur animator, then i stumbled into a fine art education but the fancy champagne parties just wasn't for me.

These days I am contractor running my own small shop, outside of client work I am javascript based game development, I am available fore hire so feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting project going on, I'm well versed in C, C++ and JavaScript (front and backend).

## Why do you blog?
I've learned way to much, and i like teaching.

## How can I contact you?
