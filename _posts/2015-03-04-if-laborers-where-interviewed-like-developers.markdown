Non-technical people tend to have strong opinions about technology, and what technology to use. Back then Ruby on Rails was starting to see the spotlight, I had a lot of people wanting to switch over their platform with no discernible reason.  No functionality change, I was just porting, at the time I liked rails and needed the work so I didn't really complain.

These kind of situations arise quite often, and always reminds me that story where a laborer has the same interview process as developers do.

## The Interview
**Interviewer: So, you're a carpenter, are you?**

*Carpenter: That's right, that's what I do.*

**Interviewer: And how long have you been doing that?**

*Carpenter: Around fifteen years.*

**Interviewer: Good, that's good. I have a few technical questions for you to see if you are a fit for our team. Is that okay with you?**

*Carpenter: Sure, that would be fine.*

**Interviewer: So we are looking to build a lot of red houses in a country-side area for residential housing, have you built a lot of red houses before?**

*Carpenter: Well, I am a carpenter, so I do carpentry and have built a lot of houses. The color of the house does not really have anything with how the house is constructed does it?* 

***Interviewer: Okay, I see, but can you give me an idea of how much experience you have with red houses? Just a rough approximation is fine.***

*Carpenter: Oh I've never really thought about keeping track of that, ahm around one year...*

**Interviewer: One year? Well, we were really looking for someone with a lot more experience with red houses, but I have some more questions here so let us carry on.**

*Carpenter: Well, okay, I can't see why the color would matter...*

**Interviewer: Ok, well... How about pine?**

*Carpenter: What?*

**Interviewer: Have you worked much with pinewood?**

*Carpenter: Sure, all kinds of wood.*

**Interviewer: But how many years of pine experience do you have so far?**

*Carpenter: Geez, I'm really not sure, I didn't count.*

**Interviewer: Ok, well, estimate it for me then.**

*Carpenter: I'd say I have a year and a half of pine.*

**Interviewer: Would you consider yourself an entry level pine person or a pine master?**

*Carpenter: A pine master? What is a pine master? But yes I have used pine.*

**Interviewer: But are you a pine master?**

*Carpenter: Well, I'm a carpenter, so I have worked with all kinds of wood...*

**Interviewer: Yes, yes, but we're using Pine, are you okay with that?**

*Carpenter: Pine is fine! Whatever you want.*

**Interviewer: What about black pine?**

*Carpenter: What about it?*

**Interviewer: Well we have had some carpenters in here, but come to find out they weren't black pine carpenters. Do you have black pine experience?**

*Carpenter: Sure...*

**Interviewer: Okay great! One more thing, we are using sticky glue to erect the houses, have you used sticky glue to erect a house before?**

*Carpenter: Well..I have heard some were experimenting with sticky glue but I don't think its a long term solution*

**Interviewer: But other companies are using sticky glue. Are you saying sticky glue does not work?**

*Carpenter: No, I'm not saying sticky glue doesn't work, it's just that I think screws, nuts and bolts work better.*

**Interviewer: Well, our architects have all started using sticky glue, and they like it.**

*Carpenter: Well, I'm sure they do, but i can see some issues with that, and... Look, I need the work, so I'm definitely willing to try sticky glue if you want me to.*

**Interviewer: OK, well we have a few other candidates to meet in the next few days, so we will give you a call and let you know.**

*Carpenter: Well, thanks for your time. Nice meeting you.*

## The Follow Up

**Interviewer: Hello?**

*Carpenter: Hello. Remember me, We met for an interview a few weeks ago, Just thought i would check in to see if you have made a decision.*

**Interviewer: We have, and thank you for coming in, but we decided to go with someone who has done a lot of work with red.**
*Carpenter: Really? So I lost the job because I didn't have enough experience with red houses?

**Interviewer: Well, it was partly because of that, but we also got the other guy alot cheaper.**
Carpenter: Really, how much experience does he have with red?

**Interviewer: Well, he's not really a carpenter, he's a used car salesman, but he has sold a lot of red cars and we think it will be much better to buy mobile homes.**
